# Cerebro Studio

AI audiovisual production and market-intelligence platform.

## Architecture

- Next.js + TypeScript frontend/server
- Supabase database, auth and storage
- Vercel deployment
- Official platform APIs and OAuth connectors
- Approval gates before publishing or external actions
- Rendering workers/FFmpeg for heavy audiovisual processing

## Core workflow

Market intelligence → opportunity → approval → production → storyboard → assets → render → repurpose → publication approval → distribution → analytics → learning.

## Security principles

- Row Level Security on user-owned data
- No secrets committed to Git
- OAuth tokens handled server-side only
- Audit trail and explicit publication approvals
- Asset provenance/licensing metadata
